# images_app
A full stack application built using React for the frontend and Python with Flask for the backend. It fetches images from Unsplash.com through API calls and displays them in the frontend user interface. Users can search for images and the search queries return images from the Unsplash.com API. The backend handles API requests, interacts with Unsplash, and serves the retrieved image data to the frontend. Both the frontend and backend services are containerized using Docker.
